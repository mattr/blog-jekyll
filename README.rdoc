= Personal Blog

This repository is the code for my blog at http://mattredmond.com. All data within the _posts directory is copyrighted by me. Fonts are referenced from the Google Font Directory (http://code.google.com/webfonts); please check there for licensing information.

Otherwise, feel free to use any layout etc. The _config.yml file is not included (since it varies between my dev and production systems). The only additions to the standard Jekyll entries are base (the base deployment url for the site, e.g. '/blog') and the disqus reference.
