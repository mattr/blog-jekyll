I was most pleased to see that "Borderlands":http://store.steampowered.com/app/8980/ was being discounted on Steam this week. It is a game I have been most interested in trying out.

Not so happily, did I notice that, while the rest of the world receives the game at the awesomely awesome price of $10.19 (or â‚¬10.19 in Europe), Australian consumers get thoroughly shafted with our discounted price of $27.19 being only slightly cheaper than the standard (for the rest of the world) of $29.95. Likewise, our 4-pack version comes in slightly cheaper (after discount) than the regular price for everyone else.

Seriously, guys - WHAT. THE. FUCK?

(All prices in USD.)
