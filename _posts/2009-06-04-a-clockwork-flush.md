title: A Clockwork Flush

**REPOSTED FROM THE [OLD SITE](http://intouchwiththeobvious.wordpress.com/2009/06/04/a-clockwork-flush/)**

Seeing this [headline](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090603180934.htm), I couldn't help but wonder if we're headed for some sort of Pavlovian nightmare, where everyone needs to piss when they hear a particular song on the radio.

I, for one, welcome our warm, wet, musical overlords.

(For what it's worth, the article was slightly clearer than the headline.)
