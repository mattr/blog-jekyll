title: Setting up Redcar Editor on Windows 7 64-bit
---

I'm rather enamoured with [RedCar](http://redcareditor.com) at the moment. It's a nice alternative to TextMate, and since I've had to switch over to a Windows machine at work (I still have my Mac, but primarily developing in .NET these days), I wanted an editor for day-to-day stuff, and since I was already used to TextMate...

I've previously installed gEdit and GVIm on Windows boxes. I like GVIm (I even switched to it for a while on Mac); however, the steep learning curve to proficiency isn't really effective at the moment, since this is for simple scripting rather than full-blown project development.
