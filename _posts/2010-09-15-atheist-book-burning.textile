bq. Emboldened by the pastor's book-burning, in a move calculated to make further trouble by a gross act of free speech, Queensland lawyer Alex Stewart tore a page from Darwin's _The Descent of Man_, saying he could make neither head nor tail of the thing by reading it and thought it might make more sense when smoked.
