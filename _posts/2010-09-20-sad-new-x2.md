**First:** [Mike Portnoy has left Dream Theater](http://dreamtheater.net/news_dreamtheater.php#pressrelease).

Mike was such a driving force in the band (which I understand is the main reason for his departure). It will be interesting to see who fills in here. I could see either of the following taking the stool (at least temporarily):

* Nick D'Virgilio (Spock's Beard); or
* Mark Zonder (ex-Fates Warning).

I'd love to hear _either_ of these guys with DT; especially Nick as it would be a distinct departure from SB's style.

**Second:** [GOG.com](http://www.gog.com) is currently [shut down](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/103601-GOG-com-Closes-its-Digital-Doors) without warning or explanation.

I have a lot of games through GOG.com; it was a beacon of usability (both games _and_ website - as a web developer, I frequently used it as an example of great design) and reason in this DRM-infested age. I will be sad to see it go or switch to a DRM-laden system. The lack of DRM was, for me, a massive incentive to do the 'right thing' and buy a copy rather than seek it out through alternate means.

There's still a *lot* of games in my account that I haven't downloaded, as well as many more on my wishlist. I'm hoping for a swift return, although the following [twitter update](http://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/24772660481) does not bode well for a DRM-free future:

> Sometimes it's really hard being DRM-free... hard to keep things the way they are and keep management and publishers happy :(

Publishers' obsession with DRM still bewilders me. Sure, a disc-check is fine; using a content-delivery system like Steam also affords you a level of protection. But the insistence on the invasive and damaging efforts to punish legitimate users is mystifying.
