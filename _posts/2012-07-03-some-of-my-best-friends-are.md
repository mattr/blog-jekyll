This is something that has been weighing on me for a while. It's about context.

It's a common defence, when charged with making a racial or sexual slur/comment/joke, to respond with "some of my best friends are {x}", as if that somehow makes the bigotry any less.

It's a really, really dumb defence.

Like really really really.

Because not all of {x} are your friends. Most of them don't even know you. By appropriating everything about {x} because you're friends with some subset of {x} you're still being offensive. Your gay friend might be OK with using the term 'gay' in a derogatory (non-sexual) way, e.g. "that's so gay".

That's fine. If your friend is OK with that (and I have gay friends who use that exact expression), you have context.

If you're not just talking with your friend, then it's damned well not OK.

Privilege is an easy thing to miss. Being a white, hetero, cisgender male is [the easiest setting](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/) in the game of life. Don't be a dick about it.
