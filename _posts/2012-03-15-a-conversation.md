title: A Conversation
---
_(**Background:** I placed an order on Wednesday 7/3 for electricity to be connected to my new house on Friday 9/3. I called on 9/3 to find out why the power wasn't connected and was told that the request was entered for Tuesday 13/3, which was the date for the disconnection from my old house. The provider, TruEnergy, then put in a new request -- which ultimately caused a system error -- for 9/3, which I discovered when I rang on Monday 12/3 -- a public holiday in my state, so the power could not be connected then anyway -- to find out why the power had not been connected. I followed this up on Tuesday 13/3 when the power had still not been connected by 6pm. The following is a summary of the conversation I had with their customer service department on Wednesday 14/3 after hours on the phone over the weekend sorting this out.)_

Me: What I'd really like is an explanation of how you managed to cancel the connection request after I was assured on Monday that it was still in the system for Tuesday.

TruEnergy: It's not showing up in my notes. It wasn't cancelled. There's an order raised here at 7.01pm...

Me: ...which is when I called after ETSA advised me that the previous connection request was cancelled by the provider, i.e. you.

TE: There's nothing in the notes to say that that it was cancelled.

Me: Yet ETSA has it on record that it was.

TE: The connection team would have known it was scheduled for yesterday so they would have raised it...

Me: But the operation hours for ETSA are midday to midnight, so why would it only be raised at 7.01pm, which just happens to coincide with the time I rang?

TE: Look, according to the notes, it wasn't cancelled...

Me: I have it on good authority from ETSA that it was.

TE: There's nothing in the notes for the account...

Me: Good thing the calls are recorded, as you've been at pains to remind me on several occasions. Please, take a few minutes to review the call from yesterday, and from Monday while you're at it.

TE (without reviewing the calls): When they put in the order for Friday night it would have cancelled both of them.

Me: But when I spoke to you on Monday, I was told that the original request was still in the system, so it can't have been cancelled by the Friday night request.

TE: Uh....

Me: Also, your story has changed. Was it cancelled or not?

TE: Just a minute...

TE (Supervisor): This is &lt;TE Shift Supervisor&gt; How can I help?

Me: I'm sure &lt;TE Operator&gt; has explained the situation.

TES: Yes.

Me: So I'd like an explanation for how you managed to cancel the connection request *after* I was assured on Monday that it was all in the system ready to go for Tuesday.

TES: There's nothing in the notes to show that it was cancelled.

Me: m-/ &lt;Explain everything again&gt;

TES: Uhhh... computers... and stuff.
