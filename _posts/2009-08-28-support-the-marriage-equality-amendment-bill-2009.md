title: Support the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009
---
*REPOSTED FROM THE [OLD SITE](http://wp.me/pmPll-58)**

[Australian Marriage Equality](http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/senatesubmission.htm) is calling for support for the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009, which would alter the wording of the Marriage Act 1969 to allow unions between same-sex couples.Â  The inquiry has recently been flooded by anti-gay submissions by the Religious Right. Do your bit to redress the issue. My submission is below, and may be used in whole or in part by anyone wishing to support the amendment.

The submissions **close today** so you need to get in quick!

Dear Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee,

This is my submission to your inquiry into marriage equality. I fully endorse the submission made by Australian Marriage Equality in favour of the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009.

I believe that no Australian should be discriminated against on the basis of his or her sexual orientation. While I am not directly affected by the amendments, I have many friends who are. I believe that they should be able to enjoy all the rights -- and responsibilities -- to which I, as a heterosexual, am entitled. (Indeed, I am loathe to partake in such an institution as marriage until this imbalance has been redressed.)

There is no rational basis for the objections to same-sex marriage. Those who object to it out of 'tradition' would do well to be reminded that marriage has already evolved from a purely religious ceremony to a secular institution. It is time that we took the next step and gave all Australian adults, irrespective of race, religion or sexual preference, an equal right to marry and have such a union recognised by Australian law.

(With the above in mind, I also support the right of individual churches not to perform these unions if that is their determination. No one is asking that they perform ceremonies which conflict with their belief systems; only that they do not impose such restrictions on those outside their faith.)

Yours sincerely,
Matt Redmond
