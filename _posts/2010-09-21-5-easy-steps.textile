title: 5 easy steps to a simpler blog design
---
Over at "Web Designer Depot":http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/09-5-easy-steps-to-a-simpler-blog-design/ is an interesting article on simplifying blog design. Summarised, these are:

# *Put content front and centre.* Check.
# *Get rid of unnecessary elements in your posts.* Mostly text, quotations and code blocks. Occasional images. So, check.
# *Get rid of unnecessary sidebar elements.* Check. Got rid of the entire sidebar.
# *Shorten the header's height.* Check for the migration from Wordpress. Smaller again with the latest incarnation.
# *Reduce the number of colours.* 5 shades of grey (excluding syntax highlighting in code).

Personally, I hate cluttered pages. I'm still considering updating these pages to use a lead line for the index page rather than the full post.
