title: "Within Temptation - The Unforgiving"
---

Within Temptation is one of those bands that divides metal fans; while they started with distinctly gothic symphonic roots, their later *oevres* have tended towards a more mainstream rock sound. _The Unforgiving_ is no exception, and in fact pushes this direction even further. It is, perhaps, the best example of what Evanescence could -- some may say *should* -- have been.

What makes _The Unforgiving_ worthwhile, however, is that, while it may tend towards a more radio-friendly rock sound, it does it extremely well. Not only are the individual songs well-crafted, the album presents a cohesive concept not found in modern popular music. The scope of this project even extends beyond the album itself, with WT presenting a graphic novel and three short films surrounding the single releases.

It's not a perfect album; some of the introductions sound very derivative, from the Marillion-esque 'Fire And Ice' (very reminiscent of 'Lavender' from _Childhood's End_), to the decidedly Cutting Crew sound of the second single 'Sin√©ad' (every time, I still expect it to be '(I Just) Died In Your Arms Tonight'). These are minor quibbles though (and given the context of the songs, the derivation actually makes quite a lot of sense), but they strike a little too close to the original for my liking.

What makes this album stand out, however, is the keyboard arrangements. The guitars rarely stray from their power chord roots, but what could have been a mediocre rock album is lifted by some truly great string and electronic arrangements. Listen to this album if for no other reason than this.
