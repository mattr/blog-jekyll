title: Overthinking it -- Back To The Future
---
Wife and I recently watched the first two "Back To The Future" movies, with number three lined up for the near future. I have always loved these movies, particularly part two; only this time, something bugged me, particularly in part two.

Why don't alterations in the space-time continuum (STC from hereon) affect Marty and the Doc?

For example, old Biff's trip back to 1955 should have altered the future which Marty1985 and Doc1985 were currently inhabiting, without them being aware of it, indelibly altering them to know everything from the alternate 1985 (technically the second alternate 1985, since the first film created an alternate 1985 in which George is a famous writer).

So let's get the timelines straight:

* There is a canonical 1955.
* There is the original 1985 which exists prior to Marty's trip back to 1955. We'll call this 1985-0.
* There is the first alternate 1985 which exists after Marty's trip back to 1955 (first time). We'll label this one "George's 1985", or 1985-G for short, since he's clearly the winner.
* There is only one version of 2015 shown, technically the future of George's 1985, 2015-0 having been erased by Marty's earlier intervention; however, this version still contains two potential futures -- one where Marty Jr goes to prison, one where Griff does. Due to Marty's influence, Griff going to prison becomes the canonical event.
* There is the second alternate 1985 which exists after old Biff's trip back to 1955. We'll label this one Biff's 1985, or 1985-B for short.

If we accept the first film as canonical for time-travel, it sets up a few things.

1. It is likely that Doc engineered befriending Marty in 1985 due to them having met in 1955. It also explains why he would invest his entire family fortune in developing the time machine. This is circular but not paradoxical.
2. Temporal dislocation (i.e. being somewhere other than your natural time) prevents memory alteration. Since Jennifer never wakes up in 1985-B, we don't know if it would affect her or how. But we do know that Marty's siblings exist as if 1985-G were the "one true reality", so we can assume the same occurs to Jennifer.

For 2 we have to consider the events of the first film. Given that Marty indelibly alters his own future by altering that of his parents, the Marty who traveled back in time *should* have been changed from 1985-0 Marty to 1985-G Marty, and should have known *only* the existence of George's 1985. Since his memory is unaffected, we assume that since he is *in* 1955 when the change occurs, his memory is unaffected and he remains "original 1985" Marty, instead of becoming "George's 1985" Marty. It does, however, mean that Doc *is* altered from 1985-0 Doc to 1985-G Doc. It's not an entirely satisfactory explanation, but it gives us something to work with.

This leads to the Biff paradox. The 2015 to which Biff returned the Delorian is technically *not* the same future from which he stole it. Since Doc and Marty are also temporally dislocated, we assume that they remain unaffected by the change, but the world does not change around them, which means that there must be a confluence in the timelines between 1985-G and 1985-B sometime before 2015. Since we don't see George at any point after Biff's theft of the Delorian, we don't know if he still exists in 2015 or simply vanishes from existence as the reality alters around him.

(Another thing that bugged me: why didn't Doc and Marty just travel back 10 minutes in time to *before* the cops pick up 1985-Jennifer? They could even leave a note to their past-selves to do exactly this so that we don't end up with a paradox caused by Jennifer's disappearance. This changes the situation to be circular rather than paradoxical. Of course, doing so would mean the second half of the film also didn't exist...)
