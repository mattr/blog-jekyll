title: "'R18+ arguments for games don't stack up' arguments don't stack up"
---
"Refused classification" is a phenomenon unique to Australia. It sits somewhere in the void between the legitimate and the outright illegal. (With the exception of WA, it is not illegal to own RC material in Australia, merely to sell it or import it.[^1])

Within the current system in Australia, games which do not meet the criteria for an MA15+ rating are refused classification; that is, they exist in some strange superposition: not illegal, _per se_, but not available to the public.

Proponents of an R18+ classification for games would see this changed. Not, mind you, to open the floodgates to a plethora of unsanitary material; rather, to provide more information about the content of what is available here. Most of the material cited by R18+-opponents would either remain refused classification or is already illegal. Introducing an R18+ classification will not change this fact. It will, like its counterparts for film and DVD, merely restrict a certain portion from direct access by minors.

In calling the pro-R18+ lobby's arguments "[spectacularly disingenuous](http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/r18-arguments-for-games-dont-stack-up-20101111-17owc.html)", Professor Elizabeth Handsley marks herself as spectacularly hypocritical. She manages to misconstrue almost every point made in [Laura Parker's article](http://www.nationaltimes.com.au/opinion/politics/enough-stalling-on-games-classification-20101105-17h4p.html) to the point of making some of them nonsensical; she spouts some blatant falsehoods that even the most cursory research on Wikipedia could have prevented; and, when all is said and done, it is difficult to determine what her actual objections to an R18+ classification are.

In her article, Laura Parker of GameSpot Australia stated the following:

> A large number of respondents also made similar comments in the "free text" option of the public consultation -- more than 2000 people said that a lack of an R18+ classification for video games restricts the civil liberties of adult gamers and leads to the incorrect classification of content.

While not being the best-constructed sentence, the intent is clear. That is, respondents were concerned about two issues: the restriction of civil liberties and the incorrect classification of material. Two separate issues. Yet Professor Handsley equivocates the two in an argument that would make the Mad Hatter proud:

> That's right: material that should be reserved for adults is being made available to minors. Yet somehow this is denying adults access to the material they want and deserve, because they are adults.

Think about that statement for a moment. Making content available to minors is denying its availability to adults. No-one from the pro-R18+ side is arguing this. No-one rightly could argue this. It is nonsense. To suggest otherwise is either idiotic or an outright lie.

What happens in reality is that _some_ material is being made available to minors, while _other_ material is being refused classification. Based on comparison with other ratings systems, the majority of this material would likely fall into the R18+ category if such existed.

Professor Handsley doesn't stop there, however. She claims that other classification schemes provide no useful information about classification in Australia.

> 1. Misclassification. Parker bases this assertion on the classifications applied overseas -- under different schemes, with different criteria, in different cultures. These tell us nothing about what the classification should be here.

This is, to quote Wolfgang Pauli, "not even wrong". In fact, comparison with other systems provides a great deal of information about what the classification could be here.[^2] Why? Because there is already a large body of data available for comparison: that is, _every game that's already been classified_.

Whether these other schemes use different criteria is irrelevant, because it is possible to draw comparisons between the ratings of the same game under different schemes. Do this for a large enough data set and it becomes possible to extrapolate general correlations and to determine a 'potential' rating under the Australian system (including an hypothetical R18+ classification).

Furthermore, the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) classification is currently used in 31 European countries and Israel, with partial recognition in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa. These do not constitute some homogeneous culture, yet all these countries, Britain included,[^3] manage to utilise the same ratings system.

Suggesting that Australian culture is unique and incomparable to all these countries (including Britain, to whom Australia owes much of her cultural legacy) is bizarre to say the least, and further fails because of one simple fact: New Zealand has an R18 classification for games, and New Zealand culture is about as close to Australian culture you can get without actually being Australian. Comparison is appropriate.

Handsley follows up this point with the following:

> The Australian guidelines consider that the impact is lessened if violence is justified by the context (for example, a violent story line) or lacking in realism. This is how what appears to be such strong violence can be accommodated in the MA15+ classification for games.

_All_ classification systems, by their very nature, consider the context. Context is central to every classification in every medium. Certainly PEGI, ESRB, BBFC and OFLC (NZ) all consider the context. Implying that the ACB somehow has a monopoly on this defies belief.

> No doubt children would be better protected if these escape routes were closed off. But adding a new classification would not achieve this.

Actually, adding a new classification would achieve _exactly_ this. If R18+ material requires an adult to purchase (as it rightly should), it becomes the responsibility of the parent or guardian to determine whether a minor should have access to it. Handsley offers no evidence to the contrary, merely the assertion that it is so.

> 2. Lack of proof. It could never be proved to 100 per cent certainty that exposure to violent video games has detrimental effects on thoughts, attitudes and behaviour. The experiments needed to do so would be unethical.
> 
> However we do have the results of a meta-analysis conducted by Professor Craig Anderson, published in the Psychological Bulletin this year. It found, based on 136 studies involving more than 130,000 participants, that exposure to violent video games is a causal risk factor for aggressive behaviour, aggression-related thoughts and feelings, and decreases in empathy and pro-social behaviour.
> 
> Surely this is sufficient evidence to justify a precautionary approach.

Anderson's work has been widely criticised for numerous reasons: he fails to consider alternative hypotheses, he conflates 'aggression' with 'violence' and he doesn't provide critical evaluation of the studies used in the meta-analysis, amongst others.[^4]

Even accepting Anderson's hypothesis and taking a "precautionary approach" does not provide a substantive argument against an R18+ classification. It could even be construed as evidence in favour of such a classification, as it would further restrict the availability of certain material to minors.

As Handsley herself puts it:

> Another contradiction: we need to be concerned about minors' access to violent material ... and yet there is a 'lack of conclusive scientific evidence' that violent material is harmful. Again, you can't have it both ways.

Again, Handsley deliberately obfuscates the issues in question. And there is a number of issues at play, here.

1. There is a lack of conclusive scientific evidence that violent material is universally harmful. Different analyses have produced varying results.
2. There is a lack of evidence to suggest that games are in any way more affective than other media. That is, there is no statistically significant evidence that the interactivity of games poses a greater risk than traditional 'passive' media.[^5]
3. The current studies are largely generalised. Few (if any) have focused on narrow social, economic or regional groups in order to account for other variables. So far, genetics has shown a far more significant role than violent media.

There is also an equivocation implied by Handsley that concern is necessitated by scientific evidence. She conflates what is legal with what is appropriate.[^6] Parents should always concern themselves with their children's media habits; simply because it is legal for a 15-year-old to purchase a game does not in itself mean that such a game is appropriate for every 15-year-old. It is parents who are in the best position to determine what is appropriate for their own children. Proponents argue that the inclusion of an R18+ classification gives parents additional information to make such an assessment.

> 3. Adults missing out. It does appear that Australian gamers miss out on some things, such as the choice of which sex their character commits with a prostitute, which was removed from Grand Theft Auto so it could fit the MA15+.

Thank you, Professor Handsley, for your condescending attempt to trivialise the issue. There's an interesting point Handsley either doesn't know or ignores about _GTA4_. Both the censored and uncensored version were released in Australia with exactly the same rating. The console release was censored prior to submission (presumably to avoid the costs of either resubmission or appeal), yet the PC version was submitted in its uncensored form.

It is possible that the unedited console version would have received the same rating; however, based on the publisher's actions, it seems clear that there was a significant risk of it being refused classification at the time.

Even so, it's not just about 'sex their character commits with a prostitute'. It's about the inconsistent application of the current scheme[^7] and the lack of a suitable alternative. Australian gamers are rightly frustrated.

Parker's article cuts to the heart of this frustration: the Attorneys-General of Australia. Previously there was Michael Atkinson blocking any move forward, including blocking the release of the white paper for the consultation.

When the public consultation was eventually conducted (after more than a year's delay), and the responses overwhelmingly in favour of introducing an R18+ classification, gamers were then told that "wider consultation was required". It was, is, and will forever be an insult to every gamer in Australia.

What, ask gamers, was the point of the consultation? Surely anyone who was interested in replying was given sufficient opportunity to do so. The consultation was not biased in favour of the gaming industry; it was open to everyone. That gamers and games industry representatives were the most vocal on the issue is hardly a revelation.

Indeed, prior to the consultation, most non-gaming Australian believed that an R18+ classification for games already existed, that games were rated the same as films. That in itself suggests that further consultation is irrelevant: the "silent majority" has tacitly endorsed an R18+ classification by believing it already exists.

Parker summarises her position:

> Censorship ministers will meet again on December 10 to discuss what comes next in this overly-drawn out process. It appears gamers have now done everything they can. It is now up to the non-gaming Australian public to voice their opinion, support the abolishment of censorship and the modernisation of Australia's archaic classification laws.

Likewise, Handsley summarises hers:

> The classification system is not perfect; in fact it is in need of a thorough review. The guidelines need to be lined up with what the research is telling us. For example, researchers are concerned about media violence where the consequences are not shown. And yet our system treats the removal of evidence of consequences (eg blood spatters) as lessening the "impact" and justifying a lower classification.
> 
> It would also be desirable to develop a whole separate system for games, rather than just cutting off the metaphorical head of R18+.

Ultimately, Handsley's position comes across as confused. For a Professor of Law, she seems to struggle with basic reasoning and causality. The arguments presented would satisfy neither the prosecution nor the defence.

She claims that the classification system needs review, a claim also put forward by the pro-R18+ camp.

She claims that "removal of the evidence of consequences" can still be detrimental. Such modifications are almost always made to accommodate an MA15+ rating (e.g. Left 4 Dead 2, NecroVision). Furthermore, the research to which she alludes relies on a narrow selection of what is available (i.e. Professor Craig Anderson's). Conversely, MA15+ (and R18+) games _do_ show the evidence of consequences. Her argument supports _more realistic violence in games_.

She claims that it would be desirable to develop a whole separate classification system for games. There have been suggestions from within the pro-R18+ movement that Australia should instead adopt the PEGI rating system. Handsley, however, has stated that "classifications applied overseas - under different schemes, with different criteria, in different cultures ... tell us nothing about what the classification should be here."

What then, does she suggest? The only options are to modify the existing scheme or replace it with a new one.[^8] If it is to be modified, why not consolidate game classification with existing guidelines for film and DVD? If it is to be a new system, on what should it be modelled if not an existing game-classification system?

Professor Handsley has raised no real objection to the introduction of an R18+ classification for games. Instead, she relies on misrepresenting the position of the pro-R18+ lobby to advocate ... what, exactly? A new ratings system? Review of the existing system? But why bother with either of these if not to provide more detailed classification of games? Which is exactly what an R18+ classification for games would do.

At best, Handsley's arguments are confused and "spectacularly disingenuous". At worst, they are downright fraudulent.

I look forward to Handsley's rebuttal, _"'R18+ arguments for games don't stack up' arguments don't stack up" arguments don't stack up_.

[^1]: To forestall the inevitable "it's not illegal to import!" argument: yes, it is. Check with customs if you don't believe me. It's just highly unlikely that you'll be caught, or that you'll face any severe penalty (other than the loss of merchandise) if you are.

[^2]: 'Could' rather than 'should' so as not to confuse what 'is' with what 'ought to be'. Handsley makes no such distinction.

[^3]: Britain currently uses both the BBFC and PEGI systems. PEGI will officially replace the BBFC for games ratings in April 2011.

[^4]: For more details see for example, Kutner, L. and Olson, C.K., _Grand theft childhood: The truth about violent video games (and what parents can do)_.

[^5]: If there were, one might expect that allowing children to play games like 'Cops & Robbers' should therefore have an even greater effect. As it happens, the current research suggests that allowing children to play make-believe violent games is crucial to the development of empathy.

[^6]:As a crude analogy, consider the case of someone viewing pornography on a public library computer. While it is technically not illegal, one would be hard-pressed to argue that it could ever be appropriate.
