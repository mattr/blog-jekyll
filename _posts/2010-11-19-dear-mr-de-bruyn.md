Dear Mr de Bruyn,

[You state](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/19/3070792.htm):

> "We all know that marriage is between a man and a woman not just because that is what the definition of the Marriage Act says but simply because this has been the way that it has been in the existence of the human race."

Until the last decade, under the Howard r&eacute;gime, there was no such clause in the Marriage Act. Our former government legislated this bigotry.

And the second half of your statement doesn't even make sense. Marriage has _not_ existed for as long as the human race. It is a construct whose roots can be traced back approximately [5,000 years](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2000/10/26/204128.htm).

Homosexuality, on the other hand, predates the human race.

Continuing to oppose gay marriage is not remaining centrist, as you claim. It is, rather, continuing the Labor Party's alarming transition to the right.
