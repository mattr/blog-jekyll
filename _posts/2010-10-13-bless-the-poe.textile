I'm beginning to wonder if the pope may, in fact, be a "Poe":http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Poe's_Law.

First there were his comments about the "evils of secular government":/2010/09/17/f--k-the-pope.

Now he claims that new technology "make it impossible to distinguish truth from illusion and can lead to confusion between reality and virtual reality." ("Source":http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/technologies+confuse+reality+fiction+Pope/3643380/story.html.)

bq. The image can also become independent from reality, it can give birth to a virtual word, with various consequences -- above all the risk of indifference towards real life.

Much like the Bible, really.

It would be funny if it weren't for so many people taking him seriously.
