Dear Steven Fielding,

Fuck you.

For starters, late-term abortions are _illegal_ in Australia unless there has been proven (by a trained medical professional) that the mother risked serious injury or death.

Second, you clearly have no understanding of what it means to be pregnant, nor what having an abortion actually entails for a woman. To suggest that this sort of behaviour would be even a _remote_ possibility shows that you also have very little understanding of human nature. It is undignified.

You are, unequivocally, an arsehat.

Sincerely,
Matt Redmond
