title: F**k script
layout: post

I frequently find myself frustrated by various things while working at the command line (usually due to my own idiocy, or external factors -- the actual command line itself gets much love). So I wrote this little frustration script, named "<code>fuck</code>", which resides in <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and is called with one or more arguments:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

epithet = ARGV.join ' '
if epithet =~ /^you.*$/i
  puts "Yeah? Well, same to you too, buddy!"
elsif epithet =~ /^me.*$/i
  puts "Awww. What's the matter, buttercup?"
elsif epithet =~ /^off.*$/i
  puts "Yeah, just take your ball and go home, precious."
else
  puts "Not likely, champ."
end
{% endhighlight %}
