title: 5 easy steps to a simpler blog design
---
Over at [Web Designer Depot](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/09-5-easy-steps-to-a-simpler-blog-design/) is an interesting article on simplifying blog design. Summarised, these are:

1. **Put content front and centre.** Check.
2. **Get rid of unnecessary elements in your posts.** Mostly text, quotations and code blocks. Occasional images. So, check.
3. **Get rid of unnecessary sidebar elements.** Check. Got rid of the entire sidebar.
4. **Shorten the header's height.** Check for the migration from Wordpress. Smaller again with the latest incarnation.
5. **Reduce the number of colours.** 5 shades of grey (excluding syntax highlighting in code).

Personally, I hate cluttered pages. I'm still considering updating these pages to use a lead line for the index page rather than the full post.
