title: Education as a Commodity
status: draft
---
I'm a firm believer that the government should be responsible for the provision and maintenance of infrastructure (but not the commercial application thereof). The Telstra sale was problematic, in my opinion, because the infrastructure was sold along-side the retail arm. The NBN looks like it could fix that, returning infrastructure to government control, and the government acting as a wholesaler to any interested party.

Same goes (generally at a state level) for water and electricity. Government provides infrastructure and maintenance (funded by commercial leases) provides a level playing field for anyone to enter the market. It incentivises companies to provide a better _service_ to their customers, since the government provided _product_ is a baseline. (It's good in theory; I'm not sure of what sort of problems one might encounter in practice. I am willing to accept enlightenment in the comments, however.)

Given this premise, would it also be possible to treat education (or health or ...) as a commodity?

The government provides a baseline (e.g. the curriculum) and schools provide incentives?
