*REPOSTED FROM THE "OLD SITE":http://intouchwiththeobvious.wordpress.com/2009/06/29/set-your-irony-meter-to-spoing/*
From "ABC News":http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/25/2608595.htm:

bq.. Country Liberals Senator Nigel Scullion says as long as same sex couples are treated equally, there is no need for them to marry.

"As long as there is absolutely no discrimination against individuals materially when they enter into a union for life the definition of marriage simply means that we can come up with another name for another union."

p. Not allowing people to _marry_ on the basis of sexual orientation _is not treating them equally_. Requiring the union to have a title other than 'marriage' because it doesn't fit your preconceived notions _is_ discrimination.

DUMBASS.
