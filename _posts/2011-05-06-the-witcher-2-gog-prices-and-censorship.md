title: The Witcher 2, GOG.com, Australian price hike and censorship
---

Kotaku Australia broke the [news][source] earlier today that digital distributor
[GOG.com][] would be increasing their price and providing the (ever-so-slightly)
modified version of the game for Australian purchasers, along the lines of the
change already made by [Steam][].

Over on their [Facebook][] page, GOG.com seems to be copping a lot of flak from
some users over this, and while it definitely sucks, I can't help but feel the
anger is rather misplaced; GOG.com, after all, are merely the messengers of
these poor tidings. The responsibility lies, in my opinion, with the publisher,
who I believe may have forced CD Projekt Red's hand (and therefore GOG.com's) in
the matter.

As I've noted in comments on the thread there, it seems reasonable to cojecture
the following:

1.  The Australian publisher is concerned that providing

    1. a cheaper price, and
    2. a superior (i.e. 'uncensored') product

    via online retailers will ultimately hurt their bottom line.
2.  The publisher therefore puts in a request to CDPR to up the price and use
    the censored version.
3.  CDPR acquiesce on the basis that *not* doing so would ultimately prove more
    problematic, e.g. contractual breach which could kill current and future
    relations with the publisher.
4.  GOG.com have to go with the request of CDPR; however, they do their best to
    mitigate the fallout by

    1.  honouring the pre-order price,
    2.  giving consumers a decent heads-up to make use of the pre-order before
        the price hike comes into effect, and
    3.  providing $26 of store credit for people who miss out on the pre-order.

How anyone could reasonably be mad at GOG.com of all those involved in this
pipeline is beyond me. FFS, they're effectively giving you an additional $26 of
games if you miss out on the pre-order. You're effectively getting the pre-order
price, with the condition that you buy a few extras from GOG.com.

Lots of people also seem to be confusing GOG.com with CD Projekt Red.

**THEY ARE NOT THE SAME COMPANY, PEOPLE! THEY ARE *SISTER* COMPANIES.**
