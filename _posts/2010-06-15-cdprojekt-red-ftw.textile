I've been a big fan of CD Projekt Red for a while now. I really enjoyed The Witcher, and my collection on "GOG.com":http://gog.com seems to be expanding near daily. Now they have ["published":http://tw2.thewitcher.com/forum/index.php?topic=29226.0] their internal DRM policy (which can be seen by the DRM -- or lack thereof -- in The Witcher and on GOG.com).

The Witcher had a clever DRM scheme, along the lines of "Batman: Arkham Asylum":http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/94524-Arkham-Asylum-Pirates-Get-a-Gimpy-Batman.

Even without the official publication, the comments and actions of CD Projekt Red have, in the past, encouraged me to buy their stuff. From the comments so far, I'll be lining up for The Witcher 2.
