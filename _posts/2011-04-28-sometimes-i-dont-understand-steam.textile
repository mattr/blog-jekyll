Yet 'The Dragon Knight Saga' includes a complete reworking of 'Ego Draconis' as well as new content. It's like asking people to pay more for 'The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay' than for 'Dark Athena'.

Also compare:

The GOTY edition contains all the downloadable content; yet I can still purchase the game _without_ this content for the same price (and then pay the same price again for the DLC)?

What gives, Valve?
