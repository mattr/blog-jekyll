title: Divinity II

I was excited about the release of _Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga_, even though I only recently (i.e. a few months ago) purchased the original _Divinity II: Ego Draconis_.

Then I noticed this:

New publisher, new stupid DRM. Note that the original _D2:ED_ version has no 3rd party DRM on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/27220/). (I purchased the retail version, also without this restriction.)

The only thing that seems to have changed is the publisher, from DTP Entertainment, to Focus Home Interactive. None of the other FHI titles seem to have this DRM either.

So what prompted the change?

SecuROM is a bit like the Y2K 'bug'. There was only a handful of systems which would ever be affected by that bug (notably financial institutions which were reliant on older systems with a two-digit year); yet everywhere I went, _everything_ had to be tagged as 'Y2K compliant'. Biggest dupe in history. 

SecuROM, likewise, does sweet fuck-all to prevent people sharing the game, and puts off people who would _like_ to purchase the game legitimately but don't want an invasive rootkit installed on their systems, and yet they've somehow managed to sell this product to gullible publishers.

I can sort of understand the idea of limiting the number of machines the game can be installed on. I don't think it's particularly useful; when you already have a basic limitation of 'one active machine per account' on Steam, I don't think you're really gaining anything from it.

So [this](http://store.steampowered.com/app/39690/) makes even less sense:
