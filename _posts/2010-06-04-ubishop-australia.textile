Over at "GameSpot AU":http://au.gamespot.com/news/6264548.html is the news that UbiSoft is opening the Australian branch of its online store.

bq. Chad Acers from Ubisoft Australia told GameSpot AU that while the local site is only two weeks behind its international counterparts, the publisher has used this time to localise offers and pricing.

One can only assume that 'localised offers and prices' means a minimum two-week delay for release dates and a minimum 20% surcharge on the prices compared to US version (even after accounting for exchange rates).

If only they'd also release a local authentication server for Assassin's Creed II. Or even better, scrap the whole damn DRM system.
