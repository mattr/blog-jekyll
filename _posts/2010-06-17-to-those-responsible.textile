You suck.

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure you're nice people and all.

But your design is stupid. It clearly didn't account for existent pedestrian traffic.

Putting the sole pedestrian crossing at the busiest point? Brilliant. Putting it on the _far side_ of where the majority of pedestrian traffic is coming (e.g. uni)? Wow.

Blocking off the access used by the majority of these pedestrians? Pure fucking genius.

And why do you need the ticket validators? You have to go past the driver when you get on the bus. It's not a train. I haven't ever seen this design at any other termini.

Here's a couple of suggestions which could improve it (it's not too late!):

# Put a pedestrian crossing where the majority of pedestrians were already crossing.  There's even already steps and a ramp there for your convenience. *Bonus*: it's not at the busiest point and the buses don't go past there, so everybody wins. I know if fucks up your ideal one-way-traffic-everywhere scenario, but hey, we all have to compromise.
# Put in a roundabout. *Bonus*: it stops the valets from screaming down from the Casino as they will now have to give way to the traffic from Festival Drive. Also, Festival Drive traffic has to give way to buses, thereby eliminating the need to have numerous lollipop guards.
