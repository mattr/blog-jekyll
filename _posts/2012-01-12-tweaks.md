You may have noticed a few minor tweaks to the site. Gone is that dull grey background... in favour of a shiny new grey background. Now with 100% more gradient and randomly-generated noise (thank you HTML5 canvas). So now every time you view the site, the background changes slightly. Feel free to [view]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/js/site.js) and use the source, which is inspired by [NetTuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-generate-noise-with-canvas/) and [Smashing Magazine](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/30/optimize-images-with-html5-canvas/) tutorials.

I've also moved to a more [object-oriented CSS](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/) style. This is a continuing work in progress to cut down to an absolute minimum all definitions.
