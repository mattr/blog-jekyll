title: This Bugs Me

I know it's really minor.

I love the sentiment behind it.

But there is one thing on this poster, which bugs me.

The original motto of the United States was **not** *E. Pluribus Unum*.

It was *E Pluribus Unum*. It's minor. Really. A single period. But "E." is not abbreviating anything. "E" is the Latin word for "out of". It's a whole word. It doesn't get a period. Period.
