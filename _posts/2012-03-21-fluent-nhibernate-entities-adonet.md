I recently started work on a custom membership provider to integrate our legacy database with our new CMS.

First pass: ADO.NET. Because that's what all the tutorials have.

Second pass: Entity Framework. Because SQL in your code is like soooo 2003.

Third pass: Fluent NHibernate. Yes. Awesome.
